VERY IMPORTANT:

Dear Professor,

We have provided you with a prebuilt .apk that works perfectly. 

However, in order for the Google Sign In authentication to work in builds made with your version of Android Studio on your PC,
you must add your SHA-1 fingerprint (Gradle -> execute task -> signingReport) to the Firebase project. 

To do so, we provide you with the following gmail address that is set as owner of the Firebase project:

email: collabalbumprojectdev@gmail.com - password: LaisMathieu

This way you can go to project settings and scroll down, there you can add yor SHA1 fingerprint, and also view the structure of our Firebase project.
